Valid only for orders totaling $50 or more before taxes or delivery fees. Expires on 12/31/2018. May not be combined with any other promotion code. Limit: one per customer/household. All standard customer terms and conditions apply. FoodKick reserves the right to cancel or modify the offer at any time. Offer is nontransferable. Void where prohibited.
